Whether you have a student heading to college, need a quick thank-you gift, or a great stocking stuffer during the Christmas holiday (Easter basket items as well!), purchasing a gift card as an item to gift to that someone is a great way to help or give thanks to your student or friend.

Resurgent's Gift Card system facilitates your capability of selling gift cards to your customers.  Resurgent does not rely on a third party company, but instead we have and manage our own system using standard protocols, human readable information, and it has a complete audit trail.  Your CPA will love you for our system.

Our system is supported on both payment terminals, as well as point-of-sale systems.
