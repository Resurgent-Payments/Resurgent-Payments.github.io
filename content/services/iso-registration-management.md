Whether you are a nation-wide or a local financial institution, having the capability to offer merchant services 
in conjunction with your other "in-house" services is critical to your ability to acquire Business Banking clientel.

More and more, the businesses Resurgent calls on keep mentioning the pain point when their primary financial institution
does not offer merchant services.  For some, they just sign with us and it's the end of the discussion.  For most,
they wind up creating another relationship with an additional institution, complicating their reconciliation and 
forcing them to once more work "in" their business, rather than "on" their business.

Through Resurgent's ISO Registration Managment program, your institution now has the capability of offering all 
of Resurgent's services, products, and consulting as if it were an extension of your own institution.  You will have
your own:

* Invoice with custom branding
* Dedicated phone number for support and sales

For your customers, it's you.  For you, it's a service.
