Accepting credit card payments is not always as simple as having a terminal in your shop.  Sometimes, you need the capability of accepting payments integrated into your custom ERP solution, or you are in need of building a custom invoicing system that requires acceptance of payment.

In any case, most of our colleagues in the payments industry do not have available staff to assist you in implementing payment acceptance within your product.

Resurgent staffs software developers, as well as maintains relationships with developers in the United States and worldwide.  What this means for you is, whether you are a small business, a medium business with a few stores, or an enterprise with hundreds of locations, Resurgent can assist in developing custom payment solutions tailored especially for you.  

In short, we speak code.

Please inquire with us to learn more, or to setup a meeting to discuss your unique needs.
